MROLE stands for Multirole Vehicle. It is in fact a simplified model for the 'Boxer' vehicle, produced by KMW (Krauss Maffay Wegman) 
and RLS (Rheinmetall Landsysteme).
Engine/Drivetrain/Suspension mimics the original very well based on data of the manufacturers.
The steering system is simplified but functional. Details of any military role modules are not given, because it is not allowed to
spread it.
