Install the IRRLICHT module {#module_irrlicht_installation}
==========================

[TOC]

This is a run-time visualization system for interactive 3D viewing of Chrono simulations.

Read [the introduction to modules](modularity.html) for a technical background on the modularity of the Chrono project.


## Features

The **IRRLICHT module** is used to display Chrono simulations in an interactive 3D view.
Here are the main features:

- Supports all visualization shapes specified as _assets_ on Chrono physics objects (bodies, links, etc)
- The following default mouse and key controls are supported:
	- mouse left button for camera rotation
	- mouse right button for camera x z motion
	- mouse wheel rotation for camera forward/backward
	- press 'i' to see a setting panel,
	- press arrows to have x z camera motion, press page up & down for y vertical motion
	- press 'print screen' to start saving screenshots to disk
- Contacts can be optionally drawn with vectors in 3D view
- Link coordinate systems can be plotted on the 3D view


## Requirements

- To **run** applications based on this module you need the Irrlicht library (i.e. the Irrlicht.dll on Windows) 
- To **build** applications applications based on this module you must have the Irrlicht SDK installed.


## Building instructions

Instructions on how to install the Chrono::Irrlicht library are already reported on the [Chrono installation page](@ref tutorial_install_chrono). They are repeated here in more details.
   
1. Download [Irrlicht Engine](http://irrlicht.sourceforge.net/downloads.html) 

2. Unzip in the desired directory.  
   For example, here we suppose that to be `C:/engine_demos/irrlicht-1.8.4`

3. Repeat the instructions for the [full installation](@ref tutorial_install_chrono)
   
4. During CMake configuration, set `ENABLE_MODULE_IRRLICHT` to 'on', then press 'Configure'
 
5. Set the directory in `IRRLICHT_INSTALL_DIR`: it must contain the path to your unzipped Irrlicht directory.  
   In our example, browse to `C:/engine_demos/irrlicht-1.8.4`
   
6. The corresponding `IRRLICHT_LIBRARY` should be found automatically: it must contain the file of the Irrlicht.lib.  
   In our example, browse to `C:/engine_demos/irrlicht-1.8.4/lib/Win64-visualStudio/Irrlicht.lib`.
	 
7. Press 'Configure' again, then 'Generate', and proceed as usual in the installation instructions.


## How to use it

- Consult the [API section](group__irrlicht__module.html) of this module for documentation about classes and functions.

- Consult the C++ source of [demos](@ref tutorial_root) to learn how to use the functions of this module.
